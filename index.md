* CS-HU 398 - Current Topics in Computer Sci

### Projects I've Done:

Due to Boise State's policy regarding academic honesty, I'm not allowed to directly share most of the code I've written for my past CS courses. I can share a few of the ones that aren't being used anymore, however. 

* CS354 - Sudoku in Pure Ruby

Github Repo: https://github.com/GrazeDD/Ruby

Information: This was a team project, done between a group of myself and three other people. I wrote most of the internal logic-based code for the generation of valid Sudoku Puzzles, as one of the past programs I had written in Ruby was a Ruby Puzzle solver (Within the same repository in the Other Programs folder as sudoku_solver.rb.

* CS321 - BTree Project

Github Repo: N/A

Information: This was a team-base implementation of a BTree. 

* CS402 - Japanese/Chinese Character Flashcard iOS App and Other Projects

Github Repo: https://github.com/GrazeDD/CS402-Projects

Information:

* CS421 - Dynamic Programming Implemenation of the 0-1 Knapsack Problem

Github Repo: N/A

Information: We were told to write both a pure-recursion based implementation of the classic (0-1 Knapsack Problem)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem], as well as a dynamic-programming based implementation. This was my first exposure to the concept of dynamic programming, and I was pretty proud of how it ended up turning out.
